Malaria is diagnosed by observing blood films.
Need to come up with an algorithm to classify if a person has malaria

There are 6 categories of cells in the images:
    - red blood cell -> RED        | (255,0,0)
    - trophozoite    -> PURPLE     | (32,32,255)
    - ring           -> YELLOW     | (255,255,0)
    - schizont       -> ORANGE     | (255,128,0)
    - difficult      -> BLACK      | (0,0,0)
    - gametocyte     -> PINK       | (255,128, 255)

MIC write-up:

Also, I am interested in the course contents of CS 736 (Medical Image Computing). The ASC website lists no pre-requisites for the course, however, please mention any pre-requisite knowledge required. The slots for the courses haven't been released yet, so I am not sure about any clashes. If possible, I would like to take up this course in my 4th semester.
